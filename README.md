# Typing Speed Test

Made this little typing game to annoy my friends and test their typing speed. It's pretty basic but gets the job done!

## What it does

It's a stupid-simple typing test:
- Shows you a random word/phrase to type
- Times how long it takes you to type it correctly
- Tells you how fast (or slow) you were
- Throws in some light roasting for good measure

## Setup

1. Clone this mess:
```bash
git clone github.com/pragmaticdev798/typespeed
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go.

That's it. Seriously. No npm install, no webpack config, no nonsense. Just pure HTML/CSS/JS like the good old days.

## How to use

1. Look at the word
2. Type the word
3. Try not to make typos
4. Get roasted by the result message
5. Repeat

## Features

- Live feedback while typing (goes red when you mess up)
- Shows your time in seconds 
- Has some... interesting phrases to type
- Will definitely hurt your feelings

## Customization

Want to add your own phrases? Just edit the `words` array in `script.js`. Go wild!

```javascript
const words = ["your", "words", "here"];
```

## Known Issues

- Might make you question your typing abilities
- Could damage friendships
